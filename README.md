# Housing Price Prediction using Ames Housing Dataset

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate housing prices based on key property attributes such as location, size, and amenities. The model is trained using the **Ames Housing Dataset**, a well-known dataset for real estate price prediction.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **datasets/AmesHousing.csv** – The dataset containing housing data used for model training.
- **preprocessing\_eda\_training.py** – A Python script that handles data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training.
- **README.md** – Documentation for the project.

## Key Aspects Covered

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw housing data for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying key features, visualizing distributions, and understanding correlations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Implementing a regression model to predict house prices.
- **Correlation Heatmap of Numerical Features**: Below is a heatmap displaying correlations between numerical features in the dataset, helping to identify strong relationships between variables.
